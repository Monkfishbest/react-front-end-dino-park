    <h4>Q) Why don't the dinosaurs rampage?</h4>
    <p>A) We keep our dinosaurs seriously drugged to avoid such unfortunate incidents.  </p>

    <h4>Q) How are dinosaurs brought back? what is this magic?! </h4>
    <p>A) A lab full of highly trained scientests grew them out of a single stock-cube that was once licked by a dog. </p>
    <h4>Q) What do your dinosaurs look like?!!? </h4>
    <p>A) Dino park's dinosaurs are best enjoyed through your vivid imagination </p>
